<p>HELLO WORLD. Im Jesse Art, Visual Artist. This is my journey, as of now you are seeing me grow. I would love to use this outlet for nothing more but to share my art with you. We aren't ever too big for anything. The world is yours as you make it. I beleive in positivity and that we are the ones in control to make positivity real. Its a ife path. YOU CHOOSE who you want to be and answer to no one. I want my art to be an expression of how I am feeling. things that I see in my mind that I would like to translate with all of you. I hope you will grow with me. Dale.</p>
